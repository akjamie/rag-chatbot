    "answer": [
        "The main components of the Kubernetes control plane include:\nkube-apiserver: The API server that exposes the Kubernetes API and acts as the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.\netcd: A consistent and highly available key-value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.\nkube-scheduler: A control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node and selects a node for them to run on.\nkube-controller-manager: A control plane component that runs controller processes, such as the Node controller, Job controller, EndpointSlice controller, and ServiceAccount controller.\ncloud-controller-manager: A control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic, allowing the cluster to interact with cloud provider APIs.",
        
        "The kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It ensures that containers are running in a Pod by taking a set of PodSpecs and ensuring that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet does not manage containers that were not created by Kubernetes."
