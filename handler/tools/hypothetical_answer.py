            Question: "{query}"

            Requirements for the search-optimized answer:
            1. CONTENT:
            - Must contain key terms and concepts related to the question
            - Must include likely relevant terminology and phrases
            - Must match the topic and scope of the question
            - Must reflect common ways this topic is discussed
            - Must incorporate probable related concepts

            2. STRUCTURE:
            - Exactly 2-3 complete sentences
            - First sentence addresses main search terms
            - Second sentence expands with related concepts
            - Use natural, descriptive language
            - Include specific terms when the question contains them

            3. SEARCH OPTIMIZATION:
            - Include synonyms of key concepts
            - Use standard terminology for the topic
            - Incorporate common related terms
            - Mirror the language level of the question
            - Include likely associated concepts

            Format Requirements:
            - Direct response style
            - No hypothetical markers (e.g., "might be", "could be")
            - No meta-commentary
            - No lists or bullet points
            - No source citations or references

            Purpose: This answer will be used to find relevant documents, not as a final response to the user.
            Return only the search-optimized answer:"""
